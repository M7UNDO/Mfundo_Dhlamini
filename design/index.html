          <h3>Goal Alignment</h3>
          <p>
            The goal of my website is to effectively showcase my work while building a strong personal brand. To achieve
            this, I will use a clean, minimalist layout that highlights my portfolio through visuals and concise
            descriptions that are organised into distinct categories. Consistent typography and colour schemes will
            reinforce a professional identity, while the About page will offer insight into my background, skills, and
            experience. Easy navigation and a responsive design will ensure visitors can seamlessly explore the content
            across all devices. Additionally, the blog and design process sections will provide a window into my
            creative and technical thinking, helping users understand how I approach projects. Finally, the site will
            encourage collaboration and future opportunities by including a contact section and links to my social
            profiles, fostering engagement with potential employers, collaborators, and fellow creatives.
          </p>
          <h3>My target audience:</h3>
          <p>
            The target audience for my site includes three key groups. Firstly, potential employers, who are on the
            website to engage with my past projects and learn about me in order to consider me for professional
            positions. Second my peers, fellow developers and people within the industry who may be viewing my work for
            the purpose of potential collaborations or networking opportunities. Lastly users who might be visiting my
            website seeking some inspiration into my design process.
          </p>
          <h3>My content:</h3>
          <ul class="design-list">
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>My blog page will feature a collection of my weekly blogs.</li>

            <li>

              artwork. Users can click on a link to play my games and interact directly with my work.
            </li>

            </li>
            <li>
              My about page will give user insight into who I am, my skills and experience, offering a comprehensive
              overview into professional background and my expertise. It will also include where I am based and how they
              can get in touch with me.

            <ul class="design-list">
              <li>
                The design of the website is sleek and futuristic. The black and white colour palette and the bold
                typography give the site a modern look and feel.
              </li>
              <li>
                The use of bold typography on different headings helps the website achieve its strong visual hierarchy.
                This contributes to its easy navigation.
              </li>
              <li>
                The design of the website is very clean and minimalist. It does a good job of avoiding clutter, allowing
                the content to stand out.
              </li>
              <li>
                The way in which the designers' skillset has been displayed on the website effectively outlines their
                range of skills and projects and showcases the designers' versatility. I think this is a good idea and
                could attract potential employers.
              </li>
              <li>
                The way the website makes use of creative typography, such as the fragmented text. This adds an artistic
                touch to the design.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Dislikes</h4>
            <ul class="design-list">
              <li>
                The website's design relies heavily on text; there is a lack of imagery. For the design of my website, I
                intend to use more images and icons. In this case, however, it does not take away from the website's
                appeal and impact.
              </li>

              <li>
                The website's design makes use of a limited colour palette. Although the minimalism is a positive for
                this website. Adding some spots of colour could potentially make the website more engaging.

          <h3>Typography</h3>
          <p>
            I want the typography of my website to have a clean and modern feel. I think this is reflected by my font
            choices below, which are Montserrat, which has a sleek geometric design, which gives it a contemporary look,
            which would be ideal for my heading and the body of my text. The modern aesthetic of the font is created by
            its balanced letterforms and its versatility, which also maintains a professional look, while Khand has a
            contemporary touch because of its use of clean lines and subtle characters that enhance the modern feel
            without compromising the user's readability. I think using either of these fonts or a combination of both
            will ensure that my website feels aesthetically pleasing and easy to read.

            <a href="https://gcrabursary.gauteng.gov.za/"
              ><img class="web-image" src="images/GCRA.png" alt="GCRA website"
            /></a>
          </div>

          <h4>Pros</h4>
          <ul class="design-list">
            <li>
              The website has a clear purpose. The landing page immediately displays the current status of applications,
              whether they are open or closed. Since applications are closed in this case, they have removed the CTA
              button “Apply Now," whereas some bursary websites allow you to click an "Apply" button only to then inform
              you that the bursary is closed.
            </li>
            <li>
              The website works just as well on mobile, as it is responsive, clear, and easy to follow on mobile
              devices.
            </li>
            <li>
              The minimalist design makes navigation simple and allows for quick access to the necessary information
              Page load times are fast
            </li>
            <li>When bursary applications are open, a prominent CTA button like “Apply Now” is displayed.</li>
            <li>The information on the website is well structured with a logical flow.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Cons</h4>
          <ul class="design-list">
            <li>
              Only “Home” in the navigation bar turns blue when active. The other pages do not indicate the current page
              you are on. This inconsistency makes navigation less intuitive.
            </li>
            <li>
              When creating an application, saving options are available. However, when trying to go back and edit
              certain sections in the application, some information is saved while other details that are typed out are
              lost, which means the information has to be retyped.
            </li>
            <li>
              The pop-up that appears when going onto the login page can be confusing, as there is no close button, and
              it took me a minute to realise that you need to scroll within the pop-up as there was no direction given.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Pros</h4>
          <ul class="design-list">
            <li>The navigation is well organised</li>
            <li>
              There is a consistent iconography that uses a gradient style, making them aesthetically pleasing and
              recognisable
            </li>
            <li>The website effectively makes use of CTA buttons like “Buy Now.”</li>
            <li>The website has a minimalist design that improves readability and makes it easy to follow</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Cons</h4>

            /></a>
          </div>
          <h4>Pros</h4>
          <ul class="design-list">
            <li>The load times are fast despite the cluttered pages</li>
            <li>
              Deals and discounts that are displayed like "ALOT FOR LESS—Save up to 55%" could allow for quick decision
              when shopping
            </li>
            <li>Offers a wide range of options, like shopping by brand, category, department, and promotions</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Cons</h4>
          <ul class="design-list">
            <li>
              The home page is cluttered. Navigation feels overwhelming, as there are multiple promotional banners
              across the page
            </li>
            <li>
              Multiple CTA buttons, like shop now, are in different colours across different areas of the page this does
              creates some visual noise
            </li>
            <li>
              The lack of whitespace due to the overload of information makes it hard to focus on one thing at a time.
            </li>
            <li>The department dropdown has a long list, and it is not actually collapsable.</li>
            <li>Too many advertisements across the page are distracting from the core shopping experience</li>
