          <h2>Essay 1: UX & UI Analysis</h2>

          <div class="essay-text">
            <p>
              In today's digital world, the quality of a website's User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) play a
              crucial role in the development of digital products, as it directly impacts how users interact and engage
              with them (Hamidli, 2023: 1-3 ). UI refers to the visual and interactive elements that users engage with,
              such as buttons, icons, and the layout, while UX encompasses the broader emotional and cognitive
              experience of using the digital system. These design elements go beyond the functionality and aesthetics,
              as they operate as signs and signifiers, forming a semiotic system that communicates meaning to the user.
            </p>
            <p>
              UI and UX do not only guide the user's actions, but they also influence their interpretation, trust and
              perception. Thus, UI and UX are systems of communication, and interaction design becomes a language users
              must read and respond to. Well-designed UI can make a digital product more aesthetically pleasing,
              intuitive and simple to use, while well-designed UX can ensure a more positive experience throughout the
              user's journey on the website. Successful implementation of UI and UX design can directly increase user
              satisfaction, loyalty, and engagement with the digital product (Hamidli, 2023: 1-3 ).
            </p>
            <p>
              Ghanchi notes that the design of a system carries an ethical weight. This means that any product that is
              created embodies a value system, clearly indicating the designer's beliefs and moral principles. Poor or
              manipulative design can exclude, confuse, or even exploit users, while good, ethical design can empower
              them by being inclusive, accessible and transparent with users (Ghanchi: 2021). This is especially vital
              when the digital platform serves a vulnerable user base, such as the National Student Financial Aid Scheme
              (NSFAS). NSFAS was created to offer financial assistance to disadvantaged South African students for their
              tertiary education.

          <h2>Essay 2: The internet, geopolitics, and digital coloniality</h2>

          <div class="essay-text">
            <p>
              In the digital age, internet access is no longer a luxury but a necessity for full participation within a
              society, enabling coordination, the exchange of information and even survival (Kasapis, 2021). The
              internet is not only a communication medium but also a geopolitical tool, and beneath the assurances of
              universal access and decentralised networks exists an infrastructure that is increasingly controlled by
              private entities, whose actions extend much beyond just business interests. This has never been more
              evident than in the recent geopolitical conflict between Russia and Ukraine, where US-based company
              SpaceX, headed by Elon Musk played a significant role in shaping the course of war and diplomacy through
              the deployment of Starlink, the largest satellite mega-constellation globally, delivering Internet service
              to remote regions.
            </p>
            <p>
              While initially Starlink received praise and functioned as lifeline for Ukraine offering critical
              infrastructure in a crisis, the involvement of a private corporation in warfare have raised concerns about
              digital coloniality, where colonial power structures are being replicated by the technological dominance
              of Western entities.
            </p>
            <p>
              This essay critically examines the intersections between internet governance, geopolitical power, and
              digital coloniality through the case study of SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet service in Ukraine
              between 2022 and 2024. By drawing on theories of digital geography as well as political economy this essay
              highlights how Starlink's intervention represents a paradigm shift in the way that digital infrastructure
              serving as both a tool of resistance and a means of neo-colonial domination. The analysis identifies key
              aspects of transformation which include: the privatisation of essential communication infrastructures in
              areas of conflict, the rise of corporate entities as geopolitical decision makers and the perpetuation of
              colonial power dynamic through technological dependence.

          <h2>Final Reflection on the implementation of my website</h2>

          <div class="essay-text">
            <p>
              Reflecting on the development of my website over the past few weeks, I feel that I have made significant
              progress and achieved most of the goals I set out at the beginning of the process. I've established a good
              base for future websites.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the most notable improvements I made was expanding on my portfolio by including and showcasing my
              3D models. I felt this was a necessary step to level up my portfolio page. While my game development
              projects demonstrated many of my skills, they didn't fully represent the range of my abilities. I also
              recognised that not every user who is viewing my portfolio would want to download and play a game so
              including interactive 3D models which users can pan, move, rotate and zoom enhances the user experience by
              making the viewing process more engaging and memorable. Although I have expanded my portfolio page, I do
              see room to develop it furthering by adding my logo designs and digital art projects
            </p>
            <p>
              Another key enhancement was implementing a light and dark mode toggle that persists across pages. This
              enhances both my user interface and overall user experience by offering visual comfort to users and also
              maintains consistency and personalisation throughout their experience on my website. I also focused on
              accessibility by adding a modal box for opening and viewing images, allowing users to click on images and
              view larger versions, improving readability. Additionally, I improved the descriptive quality of alt text
              and used aria labels for elements with no visible text but needs a description for screen readers to pick
              up.
            </p>

            <p>
              My folder structure is consistent across my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each of my file and folder names
              begin with a lowercase letter, to promote clean organisation. I also made sure to use my semantic mark-up
              correctly, paying special attention to the context and meaning of each tag. Each of my pages are divided
              into &lt;header&gt;, &lt;main&gt, &lt;footer&gt; My header contains my &lt;nav&gt; and navigation bar, my
              main contains the content divided into &lt;sections&gt; and &lt;articles&gt; were appropriate (e.g inside
              the &lt;main&gt; tag of my blog posts the content is wrapped in an &lt;article&gt;).
